# **About**
Our proposed program is motivated by an engineering problem that we are facing in the Mechanical and Artificial Intelligence Lab [(MAIL)](), where we are working on additive manufacturing using a drone. For the project, we are planning to have the drone assemble structures out of pre-manufactured (through 3D printing) building blocks. However, in order to do this, we need to have a way of taking the goal structure (in the form of an STL file) and figuring out how best to build it out of a set of predefined blocks.

To achieve this goal, the proposed program seeks to convert an STL file into instructions for building it using blocks. The program plays a similar role to a 3D printerâ€™s slicer program, which converts a 3D model into instructions for the printer to follow. This program is not limited to the specific application of drone additive manufacturing but can also be useful for building any structure out of smaller units.



# **Platforms**
This is a cross-platform application which utilizes C++ 17 Standard specific features, CMake version 3.8 or newer, OpenGL, and wxWidgets. 

# **Building**

Instructions for building the application, please see [install.md](https://ramennoodle.me.cmu.edu/Bonobo.Git.Server/Repository/Blob/23a02626-3ed4-4dd4-8157-cbf7628ddb97?encodedName=master&encodedPath=install.md).
